Place directives here, in subdirectories if desired.

In the event that a controller represents a widget, it is helpful if the name of the controller file (js/controllers/widget-controller.js) corresponds to the name of the less stylesheet (less/widget.less), the template (templates/widget.html) and the directive (js/directives/widget.js).
