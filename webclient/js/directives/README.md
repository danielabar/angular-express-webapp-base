Place directives here, in subdirectories if desired.

In the event that a directive represents a widget, it is helpful if the name of the directive file (js/directives/widget.js) corresponds to the name of the less stylesheet (less/widget.less), template (templates/widget.html) and the controller (js/controllers/widget-controller.js).
